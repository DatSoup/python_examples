# CS160 Computer Science I

# Lab 10

Objective
Work with files
Working with formatted output
Work with dictionaries

Assignment
Part 1
Write a program to ask for a series of class names and the number of credits for
that class. Ask for class names until the user enters a blank value. Every class
name will consist of the department followed by the class number. No other info
should be present. Examples might be “CSCI 160”, “MATH 165”, or “ENGL 130”.

For every valid class name ask for the number of credits for that class. The credit
hours will be integer values. Fill a dictionary with this data. Once the user has
finished entering data, ask for a file name. You may use input or FileUtils to
ask for the file name. Write out each part class name/credits pair in the dictionary
to the data file, one pair per line. Separate the class name and credits with a tab
(“\t”).

Part 2
Write each of the following functions. The function header must be implemented
exactly as specified. Write a main function that tests each of your functions.

Specifics
In the main function ask for a filename from the user and call readClasses. This
will return a dictionary with the information from the file. Each file should be in the
formation specified in Part 1. Do not create this data file in this program. Then
call each of the required functions and then display the results returned from the
functions. Remember that the functions themselves will not display any output
unless specifically stated that they should do so.

If there are built-in functions in Python that will accomplish the tasks listed below
YOU CANNOT USE THEM. The purpose of this lab is to get practice working
with dictionaries, not to get practice searching for methods.

For each function that returns a numeric value determined from the dictionary,
unless otherwise stated in the function, if you are unable to determine a value
return None.

Required Functions

def readclasses (fileName) – Creates a dictionary in the function and fills
the dictionary with the class name/credits from the fileName file. Then it returns
the dictionary. No error checking is required.

def totalCredits (theDictionary) – Returns the number of total credits the
student is taking this semester.

def classesByDepartment (theDictionary, department) – Returns a list
of the class names from the specified department. The list should be created in
the function. Return an empty list if there are no classes from the specified
department. An example of calling this function might be:
csciClasses = classesByDepartment (classesDict, “CSCI”)

def classesByCredits (theDictionary, credits) – Returns a list of the
class names with the specified number of credits. The list should be created in
the function. Return an empty list if there are no classes meeting the specified
value. An example of calling this function might be:
fourCreditClasses = classesByCredits (classesDict, 4)

def isFullTime (theDictionary) – Returns True if the student is taking 12
or more credits, otherwise this function returns False.

def numOfClasses (theDictionary) – Returns the number of classes the
student is taking this semester.

def upperLevelCredits (theDictionary) – Returns the number of upper-
level credits the student is taking this semester. A class is consider an upper-
level class if the course number if 300 or higher.

def printClasses (theDictionary) – This function WILL write to the display
a table of each class name and its number of credits. Include column headers in
the output. Make sure the columns are neatly aligned, with the class name
column being left justified and the credit column being right justified. Ensure the
class names are in alphabetic order when printed. After printing all of the classes,
print the total number of credits for the semester. Use the function specified
above to determine this value. This value, with the appropriate label (something
like “Total Credits”) should have the same alignment as the rest of the
information. This function should not return a value.
